# Governance Skill

## Purpose
Prevent optimisation loops, regressions, and scope creep.

This skill exists to enforce discipline.

## When to Use
Apply this skill when:
- Repeating similar work
- Revisiting previously changed areas
- Unsure whether to make a change

## Core Principles
- If it’s not broken, don’t touch it
- Optimisation has diminishing returns
- Document decisions

## Allowed Actions
- Freeze areas that are “good enough”
- Reject unnecessary changes
- Require justification before action

## Disallowed Actions
- Endless iteration on the same problem
- Optimising for reassurance
- Undoing previous gains without cause

## Success Indicators
- Fewer redeploys
- More meaningful changes
- Clear project direction
