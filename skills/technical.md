# Technical Skill

## Purpose
Maintain a stable, performant, and predictable technical foundation.

This skill exists to avoid unnecessary refactors and instability.

## When to Use
Apply this skill when working on:
- Routing
- Metadata APIs
- Performance optimisations
- Build, deploy, or environment behaviour

## Core Principles
- Stability over novelty
- Small, justified changes
- No refactors without clear benefit

## Allowed Actions
- Fix broken or inefficient implementations
- Improve performance when measurable
- Implement standards-compliant solutions

## Disallowed Actions
- Refactoring “for cleanliness” alone
- Introducing new abstractions without need
- Changing working systems without justification

## Success Indicators
- Predictable builds
- Good Core Web Vitals
- No regressions after deployment
